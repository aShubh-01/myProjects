		Racing games may be based on anything from real-world racing leagues to fantastical settings.<br>
		They are distributed along a spectrum between more realistic racing simulations and more fantastical arcade-style racing games.<br>
		Kart racing games emerged in the 1990s as a popular sub-genre of the latter.
